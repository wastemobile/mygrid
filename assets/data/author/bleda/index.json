Bleda's reign lasted for eleven years until his death. While it has been speculated by Jordanes<sup>[2]</sup> that Attila murdered him on a hunting trip, it is unknown exactly how he died. However, there is an alternative theory that Bleda attempted to kill Attila on a hunting trip, but Attila being a skilled warrior defeated Bleda. One of the few things known about Bleda is that, after the great Hun campaign of 441, he acquired a Moorish dwarf named Zerco.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bleda was highly amused by Zerco and went so far as to make a suit of armor for the dwarf so that Zerco could accompany him on campaign.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"bleda-and-attilas-rule\"><a href=\"#bleda-and-attilas-rule\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Bleda and Attila's rule</h2>\n<p>By 432, the Huns were united under Rugila. His death in 434 left his nephews Attila and Bleda (the sons of his brother Mundzuk) in control over all the united Hun tribes. At the time of their accession, the Huns were bargaining with Byzantine emperor Theodosius II's envoys over the return of several renegade tribes who had taken refuge within the Roman Empire. The following year, Attila and Bleda met with the imperial legation at Margus (present-day Požarevac) and, all seated on horseback in the Hunnic manner, negotiated a successful treaty: the Romans agreed not only to return the fugitive tribes (who had been a welcome aid against the Vandals), but also to double their previous tribute of 350 Roman pounds (ca. 114.5 kg) of gold, open their markets to Hunnish traders, and pay a ransom of eight solidi for each Roman taken prisoner by the Huns.</p>\n<p>The Huns, satisfied with the treaty, decamped from the empire and returned to their home, perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire. Theodosius used this opportunity to strengthen the walls of Constantinople, building the city's first sea wall, and to build up his border defenses along the Danube.</p>\n<p>For the next five years, the Huns stayed out of Roman sight as they tried to invade the Persian Empire. A crushing defeat in Armenia caused them to abandon this attempt and return their attentions to Europe. In 440, they reappeared on the borders of the Roman Empire, attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been established by the treaty. Attila and Bleda threatened further war, claiming that the Romans had failed to fulfill their treaty obligations and that the Bishop of Margus had crossed the Danube to ransack and desecrate the royal Hun graves on the Danube's north bank.</p>\n<p>They crossed the Danube and laid waste to Illyrian cities and forts on the river, among them, according to Priscus, Viminacium (present-day Kostolac), which was a city of the Moesians in Illyria. Their advance began at Margus, for when the Romans discussed handing over the offending bishop, he slipped away secretly to the Huns and betrayed the city to them.</p>\n<p><em>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</em></p>\n","excerpt":"","description":"Bleda was a Hunnic ruler, the brother of Attila the Hun.","timeToRead":2,"tags":[{"id":"wiki","title":"wiki","path":"/tag/wiki/"},{"id":"dummy","title":"dummy","path":"/tag/dummy/"}]}},{"node":{"id":"0a7922728fb39b7051e5f278849f7279","title":"Jeffsum, a Jeff Goldblum movie lines text placeholder generator","datetime":"2018-02-24 18:23:28","path":"/jeffsum-a-jeff-goldblum-movie-lines-text-placeholder-generator/","content":"<p><a href=\"https://jeffsum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://jeffsum.com/</a></p>\n<p>Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
